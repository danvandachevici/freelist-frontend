	<p>This is a toy project. I've done this as a small test, in a few hours. It should be treated as such.</p>
	<p>Please keep in mind that I'm working on this project in my spare time.</p>
	<p>The purpose of the project is to make lists. Shopping lists. You create an identity, and that identity has some shopping lists. The shopping lists can be created, deleted, completed, shared.</p>
	<p>This is still work in progress. Feel free to contribute. Links in the description at the end of this text.</p>
